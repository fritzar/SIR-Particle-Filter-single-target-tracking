function x = sample_gaussian(mu, covar, nsamp)
%GSAMP	Sample from a Gaussian distribution.
%
%	Description
%
%	X = GSAMP(MU, COVAR, NSAMP) generates a sample of size NSAMP from a
%	D-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian density has mean
%	vector MU and covariance matrix COVAR, and the matrix X has NSAMP
%	rows in which each row represents a D-dimensional sample vector.
